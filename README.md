ðŸ¤–  Quadrapet Bot Simulation in simulink 

This project presents the modeling and simulation of a quadruped robot performing trot gait locomotion. Each leg of the robot is composed of three revolute jointsâ€”hip, knee, and ankleâ€”assembled within the Simscape Multibody environment with defined mass and geometric properties. Joint actuation is achieved through sinusoidal motion profiles, with phase offsets applied to create a coordinated trot gait, wherein diagonal leg pairs move in synchronization. The robot's walking motion is generated purely through these prescribed joint trajectories. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving stable, repeatable walking and turning motions, making it a suitable foundation for further exploration of gait patterns and legged locomotion control.
