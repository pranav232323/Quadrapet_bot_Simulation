ðŸ¤– Quadruped Bot Simulation in Simulink
This project demonstrates the modeling and simulation of a quadruped robot performing trot gait locomotion using Simulink and Simscape Multibody.

Key Features
Each leg comprises three revolute joints: hip, knee, and ankle

Constructed using Simscape Multibody with detailed mass and geometric properties

Sinusoidal joint actuation drives the gait, with phase offsets to synchronize diagonal legs

Implements a trot gait, where front-left + rear-right and front-right + rear-left legs move in sync

Locomotion achieved through prescribed joint trajectories without feedback control

Simulation Outcome
Achieves stable and repeatable walking and turning motions

Validates the potential of simple motion profiles for effective legged locomotion

Serves as a foundational platform for future studies in gait optimization, robotic stability, and locomotion control
